<p>
A self stabilizing protocol for constructing a rooted spanning tree in an arbitrary asynchronous
network of processors that communicate through shared memory is presented. The processors 
have unique identifiers but are otherwise identical. The network topology is assumed
to be dynamic, that is, edges can join or leave the computation before it eventually stabilizes.
</p><p>
The algorithm is design uses a new paradigm in self stabilization. The idea is to ensure
that if the system is not in a legal state (this is a global condition) then a local condition of
some node will be violated. Thus the new could restart the algorithm.
</p><p>
The algorithm provides an underlying self-stabilization mechanism and can serve as a basic
building block in the construction of self stabilizing protocols for several other applications such
as: mutual-exclusion, snapshot, and reset.
</p><p>
The algorithm is memory efficient in that it requires only a linear size memory of words of
size log n (the size of an identity) over the entire network. Each processor needs a constant
number of words per incident link, thus the storage requirement is in the same order of magnitude
as the size of the traditionally assumed message buffers size. The adversary may be
permitted to initiate the values of the variables to any size. Still, in this case the additional
memory used by the algorithm is the amount stated above.
</p><p>
Extensions of our algorithm to other models are also discussed.
</p>
<h3>Additional Information</h3>
Following are several conditions defined in the algorithm.
<h4>Condition C1:</h4>
The node is in a legal state. Violations of the condition -
either because of incorrect initial values of the nodes' variables,
or because of topological changes.
<h4>Condition C1':</h4> 
By becoming a root condition C1 does not necessarily become true, 
however we define condition C1' which does become true. Moreover, 
if condition C1 is satisfied at all the nodes then (by transitivity) 
the Parent variables in the nodes define a spanning forest in the network. 
<h4>Condition C2': </h4>
C2' is true if node v is forwarding a request from any node w 
(w is a neighbor of v). 
<h4>Condition C2: </h4>
C2 is true if the variables related to the process of forwarding requests
are in a legal state.

<a name="simulate"></a><h2>How To Simulate</h2>
<p>
In order to build a network for simulating this algorithm, follow these steps:<br>
<ol>
	<li>Create a new network, associated to this algorithm</li>
	<li>Add as much nodes as you need to the panel</li>
	<li>Connects the node as you like - create a network</li>
</ol>
Now the network is ready for the simulation to be executed.

<i>An example for a network after a few steps were executed. 
You can note that there are nodes that already joined a tree (annotated by a directed arrow, 
pointing the parent node). Also, there are nodes that are participating in forwarding requests
</i>
</p>
<ul>
	<li><i><b>Ask</b> - As seen in the image, node 2 forwards a request to node 5 from node 4 for the requesting node (4)</i></li>
	<li><i><b>Grant</b> - As seen in the image, node 5 grants node 3 for the requesting node (3)</i></li>
</ul>
