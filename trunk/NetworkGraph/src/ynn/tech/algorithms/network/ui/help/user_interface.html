<a name="overview"></a><h2>Overview</h2>
<img alt="" src="img/nas_in_action.jpg"><br>
<p>
NAS (Network Algorithms Simulator) enables you to simulate various algorithms.
You can create new networks, open existing networks, execute the algorithms,
simulate an adversary by modifying the network and the nodes it composed from, etc.
</p>
<p>
As seen in the image above, the user interface is composed of the following sections:
</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>Menu Bar</b> - Contains the various menus, enables most of the supported actions</li>
	<li><b>Tool Bar</b> - Contains the various tool bars, enables most of the supported actions</li>
	<li><b>Network Panel</b> - The workspace for composing the networks</li>
	<li><b>Views</b> - Various additional views, arranged in tabs</li>
</ol>
All the sections above are described in details in the next topics.
<a href="#top">top</a><hr>

<a name="toolbars"></a><h2>Tool Bars</h2>
The tool bar contains several separated tool bars, described below. 

<h3>File</h3>
<img alt="" src="img/toolbar_file.jpg">
<p>
The File tool bar enables the following file actions:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Create a new file (a new network)</li>
	<li>Open an existing file</li>
	<li>Save the current network</li>
</ol>
<h3>Edit</h3>
<img alt="" src="img/toolbar_edit.jpg">
<p>
The Edit tool bar enables the following actions:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Switch between view mode and edit mode</li>
	<li>Add a new node to the network panel</li>
	<li>Delete the selected element (node or connector)</li>
	<li>Switch between editing modes<br>
		<table><tr>
			<td><img alt="" src="img/toolbar_edit_mode.jpg"></td>
			<td><ol>
				<li>Move nodes - Drag &amp; drop a node in order to change its location</li>
				<li>Connect nodes - In order to connect two nodes - click on a node, 
					drag while still pressed, release over the node to connect to</li>
			</ol></td>
		</tr></table>
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>Simulation</h3>
<img alt="" src="img/toolbar_simulation.jpg">
<p>
The Simulation tool bar enables the following actions: 
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Undo the last action (only actions done by the executed algorithm)</li>
	<li>Perform the next step of the algorithm</li>
	<li>This is an indicator for the current "time" in the algorithm's execution</li>
</ol>

<a name="newmodel"></a><h2>New Network Model Wizard</h2>
<img alt="" src="img/new_network_wizard.jpg">
<p>
When you decide to create a new network model, you will get to the dialog seen above.
Every network model is associated with an algorithm. This is because each algorithm
requires different node variables. This dialog lets you select the algorithm for which 
you would like to create the network.
</p>
<p>
As you can see, the dialog displays a list of all available algorithms. Select an 
algorithm in order to see a more detailed description of it. In order to create 
the network, approve the selection. 
</p>
<a href="#top">top</a><hr>

<a name="alg_exec"></a><h2>Algorithm Execution</h2>
<p>
After a network was composed, you can simulate the algorithm's execution on it. 
In order to do so, switch to "View Mode" and use the simulation actions. During the
execution, each node can be annotated according to the implementation of the 
specific algorithm. Additional information can be viewed in the Console view. You can
look at the simulation tool bar for indication on the current "time" of execution. 
</p>
<p>
In order to simulate an adversary, switch back to "Edit Mode", select the "Variables"
view, and modify the variables (according to the definition of the specific algorithm).<br>
For more information, see the information on the specific <a href="help.html#algorithms">algorithms</a>. 
</p>
<br>
<table class='info'>
	<tr>
		<td class='title'>
		<span class='icon'>&nbsp;&nbsp;i&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
		Note
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class='content'>
		After any manual modification of the network (add/remove/connect/disconnect nodes),
		or change to the values of a node's variables, the steps cannot be undo.
		</td>
	</tr>

<a name="views"></a><h2>Views (Tabs)</h2>
Following are several views for additional information or actions. 

<h3>Console</h3>
<img alt="" src="img/console_view.jpg">
<p>
The console displays messages from the application. Most of the messages are
related to the simulation process. During the execution of an algorithm, you
can watch the console in order to see what exactly is done in each step.
</p>

<h3>Variables</h3>
<img alt="" src="img/variables_view.jpg">
<p>
The variables view displays the various variables of the selected element in 
the network. The displayed variables are pairs of variables name and its value.   
The view has two modes: View &amp; Edit. In order to switch between
the two modes, use the button in the Edit tool bar. When in edit mode, the 
values of the variables can be modified (whether for setup proposes, or simulating
an adversary).
</p>

<h3>Algorithm</h3>
<img alt="" src="img/algorithm_view.jpg">
<p>
The Algorithm view displays the information on the algorithm that the current 
network model is associated to. This information is similar to the information
given in the "New Network Model Wizard". It should contain the algorithm's 
name, basic description of it, and sometimes further hints on it.
